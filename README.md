# AnomalySense-Detector-for-Home-Security
AnomalySense Detector is a cutting-edge system designed to detect and monitor unusual events in real-time. It leverages advanced algorithms to provide early alerts, ensuring proactive security and efficient anomaly detection for critical environments.
🚨 **Anomaly Detection for Home Security – A Machine Learning Approach!** 🚨  

Security is a growing concern, and with the power of **Data Science & Machine Learning**, we can make homes smarter and safer! 🏡✨  

In my latest project, I built an **Anomaly Detection System** that analyzes environmental factors like **noise levels, humidity changes, and air quality** to detect **suspicious activities**. 🚔  

🔹 **Key Highlights:**  
✅ **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Cleaned data, handled missing values, and created new features like **noise intensity**, which converts categorical loudness labels into numerical values.  
✅ **Feature Selection** – Used **correlation analysis** to identify the most important features influencing anomaly detection, improving model efficiency.  
✅ **Class Imbalance Handling** – Applied **SMOTE** and **Class Weights** to ensure rare anomalies (like suspicious noise) are detected effectively.  
✅ **Model Selection & Fine-tuning** – Optimized a **Random Forest Classifier** with **Randomized Search CV** to improve recall on critical anomaly classes.  
✅ **Results & Learnings** – Achieved **79% accuracy**, but recall improvement for rare events (e.g., "Suspicious Noise 🚔") remains an ongoing challenge!  

This project not only strengthened my **data science skills** but also showcased how AI can enhance home security! 💡  

Would love to hear thoughts from fellow **machine learning & data science enthusiasts** on how to improve **anomaly detection** in real-world applications!
